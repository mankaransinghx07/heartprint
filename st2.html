          He was one of the cute guy in class. Me being the studious one and introvert, he initiated the talk between us. Soon I saw him everywhere I went. Everything was happening for the first time with me.

Entering classroom looking at him, Not attending any lectures without him, Smiling like crazy when talking to him, Blushing throughout the day just thinking about him and obviously stalking him... My First Love❤️

I never had such feelings before until I met him and we became friends. Eventually friendship turned into liking and then love from both sides. I could clearly see him making efforts to be with me, ignoring other girls and also staring at me. Even I could see him fuming in anger when other guys in class tried flirting with him. He was too cute being jealous. I was enjoying and loving this phase of my life. Perfect Fairy-tale of mine.

One day he came to me and said “I like your friend a lot. Can you give me her number? “ I felt like someone stabbed me hard. Suddenly I started sweating, my feets trembling. Why? Why?? Why did he say so? I was standing there numb. I gave him the number and ran towards washroom. I cried and kept convincing myself that he still loves me and that was some kind of joke.

Next day, I tried distancing myself from him which was next to impossible. Days passed and he noticed the sudden change in my behavior. He kept on asking me what's wrong but I chose to be silent. Later I came to know he never texted the girl and neither met her or was into her. It was some stupid prank but this time he went to far.

Soon he will realized his mistake and started missing me. He came back saying sorry and I happily accepted it. Things were not going well though. Now he started to find faults in me. Saying things like I don't dress like a girl, I should start focusing on my looks, be more poised and elegant and what not.

Love for me turned into tortured now. Initially I tried changing but soon realized that I making a huge mistake. I loved being the way I was, I didn't wanted anybody to judge me or force me to become someone whom I am not. I decided to end this toxic relationship.

Before I could talk with him, I found out some other girl in class proposed him and he didn't say no. She was on waiting list I guess. This broke my heart and that day I lost my boyfriend as well as my bestfriend.

I focused more on studies and pretended to be busy in front of him. We never ended our relationship officially. I never took interest in his personal life and focused more on mine. My scores turned out to well and I left that place.

After few months he did came Pleading and begging for me to come back in his life. But he was too late, till then I moved on.

Till today, We are friends. Nothing happened between us again like before. But I like those sweet memories and feelings, everything for the first time. I still remember it and laugh sometimes. I never hated him, he never did anything bad to me. We were just not meant to be together.

Peace ✌️
