            Hailing from two different states in India, Vaidehi Malpe and Varun Chowdary Kommineni found their way to the U.S. when they began their MBA in International Business on campus. Varun’s roommate used to give Vaidehi a ride to class, but when he couldn’t one day, he asked Varun to do it. 

“I wasn’t very enthusiastic at this prospect and kept denying my roommate’s request,” Varun said. He eventually gave in and could not be more glad he did. 

“From that day on, giving her a ride was one of my most awaited (tasks) for the day,” Varun said. He was mesmerized by her from the moment they met. 

Soon, they were making excuses to see each as often as possible. “The evening rides turned into fun conversations in the car and hanging out post-classes,” Vaidehi said. “Texting increased, and so did our time together. We could talk about anything and everything with so much ease that it was surreal.”

Now, the two are married, and they could not be more thankful for the life they have together.

“Our wires crossed somewhere between the cold New Hampshire mornings, warm coffees and evening classes, (and are) entangled forever,” Vaidehi said. “Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same, and we have SNHU to thank ... for getting us together in this lifetime.”
